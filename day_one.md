For day 1, I actually outdid myself with more than 2 hours of coding after work. High points:

-I'm delving for the first time into Vue, starting with a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) MEVN (Mongo, Ember, Vue, Node) tutorial that also touches on Node, Ember, Mongodb, and Mongoose.
I am at the point currently where I have the server running with node and have seeded the Mongo db after creating my model. I'm planning
on using this for a new blog site called 'Enough to be dangerous' where I discuss newbie coding experiences and break down topics

(Logo also by me, it is goofy but I'm rather fond of it regardless.) 

-This was really my first toe into the water of noSQL databases, and also my first toe into Vue. I was struck by the similarities to the 
entire process to the many, many Ruby/Rails apps I've made. And since I deal a lot with SQL and more traditional relational databases at 
work, it was also interesting to note that like many things in code, the same patterns repeat. For instance, setting up the schema. I 
remember a time where that entire concept, that and models in particular, were very abstract for me. But now, the processes were so 
similar that it was completely fluid. Basically all you are doing in your model and schema are saying 'Oy, data - these are the rules, see? You over there - String! You over there, date!'. It really isn't so complicated. 

So, there we are for day one! Good start.
